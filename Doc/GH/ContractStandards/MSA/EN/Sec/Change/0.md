3.3.Ti=Workarounds

3.3.sec=If any {_Legal_Change} prevents the {_Service_Provider} from performing any of its obligations under this agreement, the {_Service_Provider} shall develop and, upon the {_Client}'s approval, implement a suitable workaround until such time as it can perform its obligations without a workaround, If, however, the workaround results or would result in a material increase in any {_Fees} payable, the {_Client} may terminate either this agreement or the affected portion of the {_Services} upon {LegalChange.Terminate.Notice.days}' {_Notice} to the {_Service_Provider} with no cure period.

For purposes of this paragraph, a "material increase" in {_Fees} is one where it would be uneconomic for the {_Client} to continue the procurement of the relevant portion of the {_Services}, as determined by the {_Client}, having regard to its business plans for those {_Services} as of the {_Effective_Date}.

To the extent that an agreed-upon alternative approach requires payment of an amount to a third party in excess of the amount stipulated in the applicable {_Statement_of_Work}, the parties shall share equally that excess cost.
